<h1>Making Personal Websites...</h1>
<hr>

<p>..that reflect your aesthetic, say something about who you are, and which document your experiences and projects throughout the 8th grade hackathon!</p>

<h3>Product Goals</h3>
<p>
For each young person to create a personal website that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works on computers and phones</li>
<li>Is something they’re proud to show their friends and families</li>
<li>Which captures their experience in the 8th grade hackathon</li>
<li>Which incorporates their personal aesthetic</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Process Goals</h3>
<p>Each young person leaves this experience being able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the relationship between an HTML document and the browser</li>
<li>Can translate something they care about into a website.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>General Arc/Flow</h3>

<h4><a href="./slides/index.html">HERE</a> ARE THE SLIDES FOR THIS SESSION & <a href="https://vimeo.com/384379462">HERE</a> IS A SCREECAST FOR STAFF, TA's AND WHOEVER ELSE MAY FIND IT USEFUL, AND <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jp7OMUuYZkcgccGyBf_BmPqozfosrUXJy8Kh1iRFl0s/edit?usp=sharing">HERE</a> IS A HTML & CSS CHEAT SHEET</h4>
<ol>
<li>Each student will download sublime text, git, node.js, and giphy capture from the Dalton Software Center.</li>
<li>While those are downloading, we’ll look at some great examples of personal websites and talk about what we think makes them great.</li>
<li>They’ll look at examples of and talk about about what great documentation looks like.</li>
<li>They’ll inspect some websites they love and some personal websites we give them in the console.
MJ will live code in front of them about how to make and style in HTML and CSS:</li>
<ul>
<li>A div</li>
<li>An anchor link</li>
<li>An image and related cool filters</li></ul>

<li>They’ll be given several “templates” (HTML Files) of personal websites to choose from, which they can modify to whatever degree they want so that they don’t even look like their original form at all. Each template will primarily be a journal that they’ll be styling and adding content to throughout their time in intersession. This reflective process will be what they do with their house advisors at the end of the day.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Templates</h3>
<p>Each student will choose the template they want and modify it to make their own website — HS 
The templates on our menu:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mojopi.github.io/menu-template/">“The Menue”</a>: A template with a menu bar with links for each [Day, breakthrough moment, experience, etc.] (e.g. Ella, Ciara)</li>
<li>“For the image-inary…”:The image/div for each  [Day, breakthrough moment, experience, etc.]</li>

<li><a href="https://mojopi.github.io/image-template/">“Image-inary”</a>: images and photographs representing each experience</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://mojopi.github.io/scroll-template/">“The scroll"</a>: Sections separating experience (e.g. This Teenage Life, PHS, CS1)</li>
</ul>

<p>As they’re working on their websites, we’ll be going around the room helping them. Hopefully CS1 interested HS students will also be around to support them.</p>
